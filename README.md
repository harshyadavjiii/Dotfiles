## My Window Manager
I do use bspwm I like the default tiling layout of bspwm and it's very easy to configure in fact all 
I am using is just bspwm's default config just a couple of lines here and there.

I use sxhkd for key bindings which is yet another easy to configure tool. 
 Here are my key bindings -
